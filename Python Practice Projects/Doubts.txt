While working with turtle library.
we can't user write method with out assigning input into it. 

Example:
import turtle

vinay = turtle
screen = turtle.Screen()
vinay.write() # output: TypeError: write() missing 1 required positional argument: 'arg'
vinay.write("Working") # output: Working
screen = screen.exitonclick()

Doubt: How to create a method like this by giving default if user failed to give or pass the value it should throw the error.
